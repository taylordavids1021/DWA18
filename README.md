The project is built using React and TypeScript. It leverages the Netlify platform for deployment and Supabase for user authentication and database storage.

# Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone [repository_url]
Install dependencies: npm install
I suggest you run the development server using: npm run dev
Deployment
The app was deployed to a custom Netlify url: https://marvelous-crepe-cef227.netlify.app/
